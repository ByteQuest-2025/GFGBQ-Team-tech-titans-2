AI models are smooth talkers, but they often "gaslight" users with fake facts and imaginary citations. Veri-vibe is a real-time verification layer that catches AI lies before you believe them.

The Problem
Fake Citations: AI creates professional-looking references to papers that don't exist.

Fact Drift: AI changes dates, names, or statistics with 100% confidence.

Link Rot: Generates URLs that look plausible but lead to 404 errors.

Key Features
[Claim Radar]: Automatically highlights sentences that require factual proof.

[Citation Dead-Check]: Validates every link and DOI against live academic databases.

[Confidence Scoring]: Provides a "Vibe Check" score (0-100%) for the reliability of a response.

[Source Swap]: If a citation is fake, the system suggests a real, verified source for the same claim.

Tech Stack
Backend: Python, FastAPI

AI/LLM: OpenAI GPT-4o / Claude 3.5 (for claim extraction)

Verification: LangChain, BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)

Database Search: Semantic Scholar API, Crossref API, Wikipedia API

Frontend: Streamlit / React (for the "Vibe" dashboard)
